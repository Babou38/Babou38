# Hey, I'm Baptiste 👋

Former student from **42 Lyon**, passionate about systems programming, game development, and full-stack web applications. Currently looking for an **apprenticeship** in software engineering.

I've spent the last two years building everything from a custom C library to a full-stack multiplayer web app — all from scratch, no frameworks for the core logic.
